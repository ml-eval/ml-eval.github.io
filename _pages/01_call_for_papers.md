We invite two types of papers -- opinion papers (up to 4 pages) stating positions on the topics
related to those listed above, and methodology papers (up to 8 pages excluding references) about
evaluation in ML. These topics may include: 

- Establishing benchmarking standards for ML research
  - The role of benchmarks in facilitating research progress
  - New evaluation techniques or metrics (general or e.g. NLP-specific)
- Reliable tools/protocols for benchmarking and evaluation
  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Reporting statistical uncertainty 
  - Statistical testing and metrics (e.g. multi-objective, Pareto frontiers).
- Understanding and defining reproducibility for machine learning
  - Replicability vs Reproducibility
  - Does reproducibility in ML need to be different from other fields?
  - Role of determinism
  - Understanding sources of variation in results in deep learning
  - How much rigor is needed for ML? 
- Meta analyses thoroughly evaluating existing claims across papers
  - Evaluating robustness of previous claims 
  - Reporting statistical or methodological issues 
  - Analysis of evaluation protocols on existing benchmarks
- Incentives for doing better evaluation and reporting results
  - Action items for conferences / Guidelines / training reviewers 
  - Incentivizing researchers to care about deployment (trustability, reliability, generalizability)
  - Cultural changes and software tools for reliable evaluation
  - Understanding differences across subfields in ML evaluation

# Important Dates

- Submission deadline: 4th March
- Accept/Reject Notification Date: 25th March
- Camera Ready: 18th April
- Workshop: 29th April

# Submission instructions

We will accept technical papers of length up to 8 pages and opinion papers of length up to 4 pages,
excluding references and appendices and position papers. In order to gather a wide variety of views,
we will minimally constrain the format and topic areas for both types of papers. We will not accept
work published in prior ML conferences including ICLR 2022, and encourage the submission of working
papers. The submission process will be handled via CMT in a double-blind review process. Papers can
utilize any style file they want (for e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR) and should be anonymized for double
blind review.

The proceedings of the workshop will be non-archival. We will require authors of accepted papers to
provide a recorded video and a slide deck describing their work. We plan to divide the accepted
papers into two groups with different presentation types – contributed talks (10 min), and posters
(two poster sessions) – based on novelty, technical merit, and alignment to the workshop’s goals.
