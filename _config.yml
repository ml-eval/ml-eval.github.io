    'time': '13h00',
    'abstract': "<p>Although hundreds of optimization algorithms have been proposed for deep learning, there is no widely agreed-upon protocol for evaluating their efficiency, performance, and usability. Instead, the crucial choice of the optimizer is too often done based on personal anecdotes instead of grounded empirical evidence.</p><p>In this talk, we present strategies for comparing deep learning optimizers which consider the unique challenges of deep learning such as the inherent stochasticity or the crucial distinction between learning and pure optimization. These strategies are formalized and automatized in the Python package DeepOBS, which allows fairer, faster, and more convincing empirical comparisons of deep learning optimizers.</p><p>Following this protocol, we report insights from our independent, third-party evaluation of the field's current state. A thorough comparison of fifteen popular deep learning optimizers, using roughly 50,000 individual runs, reveals that the comparably traditional Adam optimizer remains a strong but not dominating contender and that newer methods fail to consistently outperform it.</p><p>As an adjacent research direction to benchmarks, new debugging tools, such as Cockpit, allow for a more detailed evaluation of the training process of neural networks beyond just the loss or the model's performance. These tools could disentangle the many factors contributing to (un)successful neural network training, helping us understand whether training improvements are the result of better models, better algorithms, or better hyperparameters.</p>",

    'title': 'A Statistical Analysis of Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Summarization',
    'abstract': '<p>The quality of a summarization evaluation metric is quantified by calculating the correlation between its scores and human annotations across a large number of summaries. Currently, it is not clear how precise these correlation estimates are, nor whether differences between two metrics’ correlations reflect a true difference or if it is due to random chance. In this talk, I will address these two problems by proposing methods for calculating confidence intervals and running hypothesis tests for correlations. After evaluating which of the proposed methods is most appropriate for summarization through two simulation experiments, I will analyze the results of applying these methods to several different automatic evaluation metrics across three sets of human annotations. In this research, we find that the confidence intervals are rather wide, demonstrating high uncertainty in how reliable automatic metrics truly are. Further, although many metrics fail to show statistical improvements over ROUGE, two recent works, QAEval and BERTScore, do in some evaluation settings. This work is published at <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00417/107833/A-Statistical-Analysis-of-Summarization-Evaluation">TACL 2021</a>.</p><p>In the second part of this talk, I will present an ongoing study that identifies two ways in which the definition of the system-level correlation is inconsistent with how metrics are used to evaluate summarization systems in practice and propose changes to rectify this disconnect. The results from these analyses point to the need for future research to focus on developing more consistent and reliable human evaluations of summaries.</p><p>This research was done in collaboration with Daniel Deutsch, a Ph.D. student from the Cognitive Computation Group at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania.</p>',

    'abstract': 'The abilities to recognize abstract concepts (e.g. “same” vs. “different”) and make analogies is central to human intelligence, and has received increasing attention in the AI/ML community, with challenge domains such as Raven’s Progressive Matrices, Bongard Problems, and the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC).  However, the methods typically used to evaluate ML systems on these domains have failed to assess true abstraction and generalization abilities, and have allowed for “shortcut learning” that succeeds on a particular benchmark, but for the wrong reasons.   In this talk I will propose a different approach to evalution, one that attempts to test for degrees of “understanding” of abstract concepts, beyond simple accuracy measures.',

This framework is comprised of three parts: 1) Qualitiative Evaluation, 2) Demographic Slicing, and 3) Distribution Shift and Causal Evaluations. I present "Healthsheets", a transparency artefact for health datasets, in the spirit of "Datasheets", as work towards improve qualitative evaluation. I will also discuss work on identifying underspecified models, where our model may not encode the causal structure we believe it does, in situations where distribution shift is a factor. We also look at fairness properties in distribution shift situations, and discuss transfer implications of models, when broken down by demographic group. Lastly, I will make a case for the importance of uncertainty and its implications for demographic fairness, discussing work on Electronic Health Record data, Bayesian neural networks, and differences in distributions of mortality predictions for various demographic groups.',

    'abstract': '<p>In this talk we revisit the 2014 NeurIPS experiment that examined inconsistency in conference peer review. We determine that 50% of the variation in reviewer quality scores was subjective in origin. Further, with 7+ years passing since the experiment we find that for accepted papers, there is no correlation between quality scores and impact of the paper as measured as a function of citation count. We trace the fate of rejected papers, recovering where these papers were eventually published. For these papers we find a correlation between quality scores and impact. We conclude that the reviewing process for the 2014 conference was good for identifying poor papers, but poor for identifying good papers.</p><p>This 2014 NeurIPS experiment was repeated by the 2021 NeurIPS Program Chairs and we compare the findings. We also discuss other experiments carried out by ICML Program Chairs.</p><p>We hope the findings and some of the ideas from the experiments will help to design a better peer-review pipeline in future conferences.</p>',

    'description': "Examples of questions we would like to cover are: Slow or fast science, is this a false dichotomy? Is the slow-science movement a threat for exploration? Or is the current pace of publication becoming overwhelming, harming the dissemination of knowledge? Should we look for incentives to balance so-called ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ approaches and if so how could we evaluate what would be a proper balance?",
